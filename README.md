# wenweb-server
A server for a p2p WWW alternative protocol, gunjs based.

# What is WenWeb?
WenWeb is a new layer/protocol on the WWW as a hobby of mine. It's basically a secure by default, open source, easy to use, and P2P version of the WWW.

# Benefits?
* Uncensorable. (Since it uses GUNJS as a backbone)
* Open source.
* Uses simple markdown-like language called SMD (Sam's MarkDown.)
* Secure.
* Wicked fast.
* Up and running with a simple server in 30 minutes, perhaps less. (Speedrunnable?)
