# wenweb-server
A server for a p2p WWW alternative protocol, gunjs based.

# What is WenWeb?
WenWeb is a new layer/protocol on the WWW as a hobby of mine. It's basically a secure by default, open source, easy to use, and P2P version of the [WWW]().

# Benefits?
* Uncensorable. (Since it uses GUNJS as a backbone)
* Open source.
* Uses simple markdown-like language called SMD (Sam's MarkDown.)
* Secure.
* Wicked fast.
* Up and running with a simple server in 30 minutes, perhaps less. (Speedrunnable?)
* 100% free-as-in-price to use!

# How to.
* install nodejs and add it to the path.
* cd into directory
* run `npm i`
* edit index.js to have your desired domain in the **domain** varaible, NOT the *wendomain* variable
* go back to the terminal where you ran npm i (terminal in directory)
* run `node index.js`

# Supported codecs (listed as MIME-types)
***DRM-FREE*** (as in no drm) variants of the following:
* image/png
* video/webm
* audio/ogg
